	        I started by installing Java, JSON, and Gradle extensions to help me program with VSCode.
	        I followed a tutorial found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRXWa5HRAxU&list=PLlbkaeFHn13Hw_Y-Rs2TgBYlpS2RQ5uEA&index=1&t=25s
	        I'm so clueless lol
	        I updated the build.gradle file filling in my information
	        I can't get the Creativemodetab to work cuz im in the wrong version i think
	        
	    9:00
	    	I tried to figure it out and can't
	    	I forgot that 1.19.3 and 1.19 r rly different regarding creative tabs because mojang just redid them this update

 		I am watching a new tutorial and copied new code, essentially restarting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-mp91zrlqo
 		I successfully created the black opal and raw black opal items along with giving them their own creative tab
 		I created black opal blocks and dimensional ore blocks: im so tired
 		
 	9:00
 		I gave these blocks loot tables and made them mineable
 		Uploaded my files to github
 		I made crafting and smelting
 			I couldn't get crafting the black opal back into blocks to work, ill try tmrw

		I fixed the problem with not being able to craft black opal blocks, i just deleted the file then re made it with a different name the matches the minecraft naming scheme more closely
		I started working on data generations to hasten the process of implementing new blocks and items
 		
 	11:30
 		I worked on adding a new tree type to the game
 		I added all of the blocks for the tree to the game

		I fixed an issue where the sapling would show a sapling block in the hand rather than the 2d item, i solved by manually changing the json file to math with the black opal file
		I cant get my sapling grower to work and i have no clue
